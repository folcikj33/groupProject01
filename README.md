# Nomad
Nomad is a job search tool assistance tool that aggregates available jobs and quality of life details about the desired city.

## Overview
One of the biggest perks of choosing a career in coding is the ability to work remotely or get a job in the city of your choice. The goal for Nomad comes from a desire aid developers in their job searches and take away some of the mystery with considering opportunities in a new city. With Nomad, we aim to give users a central place to research open jobs and get a quick glance of what your life would be like in that city.
